I am planning on creating more content for people looking for Jobs with my previous experiences and hopefully with others who can help share too. 
I wanted to request both Job Seekers and Mentors to help join the Facebook group I created in helping others with the same.
A couple of things to mention:
i. Why Facebook? It has more configurability and easier to setup
ii. Why Now? It is imminent that people reach out and lend out a hand with all things ongoing today.

Please reach out to me [here](mailto:jobhuntingduringtoughtimes@gmail.com)  

I loved the insight and here is the [blog](http://www.onedayonejob.com/)

And here is the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3190591167643415) you definitely want to check out
