I have been evaluating a lot about bringing up a sniffer for 11ax

I found this wonderful platform from Nvidia
[Jetson Nano](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/)

Thanks to NViDiA and [Arrow][https://www.arrow.com/en/products/945-13541-0000-000/nvidia] for letting me buy it.
